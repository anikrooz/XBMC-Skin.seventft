7TFT is an special XBMC skin for mini TFT´s  (Car, xbox additive LCD´s -  or portable screens)
It works with 1080i reselution also ! :)
Special features of the skin are the big headlines/fonts and the 4 corners control. Each menu has its own color, (Music -> green, Vodeo -> Blue, Picture -> yellow, Programms -> Pink)
