~~~~~~~~ XBMC-TV ~~~~~~~~~
++++Installation Notes++++

--------------------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prerequisites and minimum system requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Television set
- Modified XBOX (either softmod or modchip)
- XBOX Media Center (XBMC) 2.0.1 or later installed on your XBOX
- High Speed Internet access (1 Mbit+), XBOX attached to it



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First Time Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If you downloaded XBMC-TV from SVN, execute the BUILD.bat included in the XBMC-TV folder. If you have downloaded a snapshot pack from www.xbmc-tv.com or http://code.google.com/p/xbmc-strm-collection/, simply skip this step.

2. Turn on your XBOX

3. Transfer the folder "XBMC-TV" to your XBOX via FTP (or your prefered method of file transfer).  We suggest putting it in the root of the E drive, so the file path would look like "E:\XBMC-TV\."

3. If you have not done so already, launch XBMC on your XBOX.

4. In the main menu section of XBMC, navigate to "Videos" and press the green "A"-Button on your XBOX controller to open it.

5. Inside the "Videos" section press the white button on your XBOX controller to open a context menu. From the context menu, select "Add source" and press the green "A"-Button on your XBOX controller to open the Add Source dialog.

6. You are now in the dialog menu "Add Video Source".

7. Navigate to the "Browse" button and press the green "A"-Button on your XBOX controller to activate it.

8. Navigate to the XBMC-TV folder you FTPed onto your Xbox in step 3. If you followed the suggestion in step 3, this should be "E:\XBMC-TV\" (to be reached by selecting "E Drive" -> Highlight "XBMC-TV" -> Press "Add" button). Simply mark the top level directory of your XBMC-TV content and navigate to the "Add button" and press the green "A"-Button on your XBOX controller to activate it.

9. In the field "Enter a name for this Media Source," enter any text you like.  We would recommend using "XBMC-TV," though ;)

10. Navigate to the "OK" Button in the "Add Video Source" dialog menu and press the green "A"-Button on your XBOX controller to activate it.

11. You should now be able to find a link to XBMC-TV in your "Videos" section of XBMC. Simply open it by pressing the green "A"-button on your XBOX controller.

Update installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If you downloaded XBMC-TV from SVN, execute the included BUILD.bat. If you have downloaded a snapshot pack from www.xbmc-tv.com or http://code.google.com/p/xbmc-strm-collection/, simply skip this step.

2. Turn on your XBOX

3. FTP into your XBOX.

4. Using your FTP client, navigate to the folder where you last stored the contents of XBMC-TV. 

5. Delete the contents of that folder, leaving the folder itself untouched

6. FTP the contents of the directory "XBMC-TV" on your PC to your XBOX. 

7. Finally, if you wish to keep up to date with revised XBMC-TV icons, you must clear your XBMC video thumbnail cache.  You can do this by navigating, either via the File Manager or FTP, and deleting the folder "Video," located in XBMC\UserData\Thumbnails\Video.
